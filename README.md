- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this project, I learned a lot regarding the tracking and modification of data based on user inputs. The difficulty of this projects seems to lie on planning out a well though-out data flow when transitioning between each step of the form.

- Had to look back into event bubbling and listeners while working on some of the forms. Example: e.target vs e.currentTarget
- Utilized Material UI because I didnt want to implement my own Switch component.
